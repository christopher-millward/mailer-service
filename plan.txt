### Goal:
  * Write an emailer micro-service that I can just git clone and deploy for any project in the future. 

### Specifications:
  * Written in typescript (to practice TS skills + increased error detection if sharing publically).
  * Can be called from any trusted endpoint
    * make trusted_endpoints part of .env file
  * Takes in 
  
  
 ### Plan:
   * Use nodemailer.js to send emails
   * Store all auth info in .env 
   * Take in just one object as a parameter
	* obj = { 
		"to": [list of recipients],
		"from": "sender@temp.ca",
		"cc": None (optional parameter)
		"subject": "subject line",
		"body": "HTML document"
	}


### Features:
* SMTP Setup
  * Authentication (.env) //DONE
* Security
  * Input validation & sanitization (for email address, subject line, etc.)
  * Rate limiting
  * encryption (TLS/SSL)
  * Spoofing prevention (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to prevent being marked as spam
* Reliability / Scalability
  * Retry logic for dealing with SMTP outages
  * Queue system (Redis + Bull, Kue)
  * Logging (for success monitoring)
* Error handling
* Auth / Access control
  * JWT and API keys for access control
